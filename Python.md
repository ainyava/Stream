#### First Stream / Subtitle Downloader

I did wrote a script for automating the download process subtitles for my movies in HDD witch exceeds 500GB if of data.

I used the subf2m website witch is a mirror of [subscene.com](https://subscene.com) and have subtitles for almost any movies and series.

#### Second Stream / Learn working with APIs and RGB room simulation connected to my Twtich chat

In this stream we did some stuff with [reddit.com](https://reddit.com) public API.

Then coded a script that reads my liveTwtich chat and connected it to a Room Simulation I created before using Unity Game Engine witch there are two lights and people on stream chat could change the colors of that lights or turn them on and off.
